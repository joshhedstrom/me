# joshhedstrom.github.io/me


I'm Josh Hedstrom, and I'm a full stack web developer and cybersecurity zealot. Currently I'm a frontend engineer at a Fortune 50 ecommerce site that handles a few million hits a day. I'm also a Web Application Security resource. I'm skilled in React, Node, and ES6. I love React Hooks and have worked with Redux. I have experience with Angular 6, Bootstrap, Firebase, Express.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. I've also worked in Java and Typescript and played around in Go.

Previously, I was the lead front end developer working on a complex cost management application for a grocery store chain, built principally with React.js. I was also a Senior React resource brought in to refactor a custom component library according to best practices.
        
Full Stack Web Development enables me to utilize my artistic and logical abilities to thoughtfully engineer precision applications that are efficient, intuitive, and maintainable. I'm a hard worker and a quick learner; I'm creative, energetic, logical and always curious. I am passionate about writing clean code that is easy to read and maintain. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy running, reading, music, brewing craft beer,and spending time with my family. I currently live in the southwest with my wife and two kids.
