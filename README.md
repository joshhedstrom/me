Thanks for stopping by! This is my personal website.

From my bio:

I'm Josh Hedstrom, and I'm a full stack developer and passionate problem solver. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax and Firebase, as well as Bootstrap and Materialize. I get excited about using tech to solve real world problems, and I have a never ending curiousity for cutting edge technology. 

I currently live in St. Paul, Minnesota, with my wife and 11 month old daughter. When I'm not coding, I enjoy running, music, craft beer, and spending time with my family.
